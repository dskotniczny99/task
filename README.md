Response Format:
```[
    {
        "name": "repo_name_1",
        "owner": {
            "login": "owner_name"
        },
        "branches": [
            {
                "name": "branch_name_1",
                "commit": {
                    "sha": "commit_sha_1"
                }

                    "sha": "commit_sha_2"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
## Testing
Test Class
The tests are implemented in the TaskApplicationTests class located in pl.skotniczny.task. This class uses Spring Boot's testing framework and Mockito to perform integration tests on the API.

Test Methods:

- test_repo_name_and_owner_login: Tests that the repository name and owner login are correctly returned in the response.

- test_not_existing_user: Tests the API's response for a non-existing GitHub user, ensuring a 404 status and an appropriate error message.

- test_not_acceptable_format: Tests the API's response when an unacceptable format (e.g., XML) is requested, ensuring a 406 status and an appropriate error message.

Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
./mvnw test
```
